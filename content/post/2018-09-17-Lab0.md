As discussed in our first class, there are two ways start this lab. You can download a zip file with all the necessary files here: https://github.com/jbryer/CRJ504Fall2018/raw/master/labs/Lab0.zip

Alternatively, if you have the `DATA606` package installed, the following commands will copy the necessary files into a directory called `Lab0` in your current working directory. 

```
library(DATA606)
startLab('Lab0')
```
