In the course we will use the R statistical program to conduct analysis. The current version of R is `r R.version.string`. However, we will generally use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to interact with R. Instructions to download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) are provided below. For a brief history of R, check out Nick Thieme's article, [*R generation*](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01169.x).

Below are links to R and RStudio for Windows and Mac. Once downloaded, install these programs. Once installed, you will only use RStudio, but for it to work you must also install R.

* Download installers for Windows: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.5.1-win.exe) and  [RStudio](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.456.exe)
* Download installers for Mac: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.5.1.pkg) and [RStudio](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.456.dmg)

Once you have installed these programs, open RStudio and cut and paste the following commands into the Console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'devtools', 'openintro', 'fivethirtyeight', 
				   'likert', 'OIdata', 'psych', 'shiny', 'knitr', 'markdown'))
devtools::install_github('jbryer/DATA606')
```
