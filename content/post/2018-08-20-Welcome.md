Welcome to CRJ 504! I am looking forward to meeting everyone. Please note that there is **no class Monday, August 27th**, as I will be out of town at a conference. I have created a website for this course at http://crj504.bryer.org/. You will find the syllabus and schedule there. Before our first class, please do the following:

1. Complete this brief survey (your responses are anonymous): https://excelsior.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2498pg03yVftSoB

2. Review the course syllabus: http://crj504.bryer.org/syllabus/

3. Review chapter one of the text book.

4. Try to install R and RStudio. Instructions are located here: http://crj504.bryer.org/2018/08/installing-r/ If you have issues, we can resolve them during the first class.
